# üîê CryptGuard v3.0 (September 2025)

**CryptGuard** is a modern, security-first file-encryption app with a Qt (PySide6) GUI.
Version **3.0** introduces a simplified, auditable core that writes a single, next-gen format based on **XChaCha20-Poly1305 SecretStream** (libsodium/PyNaCl). It delivers authenticated streaming encryption, tamper detection from start to finish, and private metadata handling (original name/extension and true size are revealed only to the decryptor).

## ‚ú® Highlights (v3.0)

| # | Feature                                                 | What it does                                                                                                                                                                          |
| - | ------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1 | **Single algorithm: XChaCha20-Poly1305 (SecretStream)** | Streaming AEAD with 24-byte nonces, per-frame authentication, and an authenticated end-marker. New encryptions always use this mode.                                                  |
| 2 | **Commitment to header (AAD)**                          | The stream header and KDF parameters are bound as **Associated Data**. Any header tampering breaks decryption.                                                                        |
| 3 | **Authenticated `FINAL` with metadata**                 | The final record carries authenticated JSON (e.g., `orig_name`, `orig_ext`, `pt_size`, `chunks`, `pad`) so decrypt can safely restore the original filename/extension and exact size. |
| 4 | **Argon2id KDF with profiles**                          | Auto-calibrated parameters. Two profiles: **Interactive** (faster) and **Sensitive** (slower/more RAM) for higher brute-force cost.                                                   |
| 5 | **Privacy-friendly size handling**                      | Optional **Pad size** up to **16 KiB** to coarsen size leakage without excessive bloat. True plaintext size is authenticated and enforced at decrypt.                                 |
| 6 | **Robust verify & integrity**                           | Bit-flips in header, data frames, or trailing garbage are detected; decryption fails cleanly with a clear error.                                                                      |
| 7 | **Polished GUI**                                        | Drag-and-drop, progress and speed readouts, **Verify** button, selectable KDF profile, **Pad size** selector, expiration field, logging.                                              |
| 8 | **Built-in Vault**                                      | Optional passphrase-protected store for your **already-encrypted** files; now also binds its header via AAD and uses secure logging.                                                  |
| 9 | **Safe defaults & sane pins**                           | SecretStream via PyNaCl/libsodium; modern `cryptography` where applicable; defensive file I/O and best-effort OS hardening.                                                           |

## üÜï What‚Äôs new in **3.0** (vs **2.7.0**)

**Core/Format**

* ‚úÖ **Unified writer**: new files use **XChaCha20-Poly1305 SecretStream** exclusively.
* ‚úÖ **Header as AAD**: the stream header + KDF params are authenticated (commitment property).
* ‚úÖ **`TAG_FINAL` metadata**: authenticated JSON carries `orig_name`, `orig_ext`, `pt_size`, `chunks`, `pad`.
* ‚úÖ **Automatic name/extension restore** on decrypt (no need to rename manually).
* ‚úÖ **Padding ceiling reduced to 16 KiB** (better trade-off between size privacy and bloat).

**KDF & Profiles**

* üîÅ Profiles renamed/simplified: **Interactive** (fast) and **Sensitive** (robust).
* üîß Per-machine auto-calibration; parameters are stored in the header (not secret) and are authenticated.

**Vault**

* üîê Vault writes/opens binding the header via AAD; logging uses **SecureFormatter** (masks secrets).
* üß± Robustness tweaks (atomic I/O, better SQLite PRAGMAs where applicable).

**Compatibility**

* üìñ **Backward-compatible reads**: older files (v1‚Äìv4) remain **readable**.
* ‚úçÔ∏è **Writes**: always the new v5 format (SecretStream).
* üß© On older decrypters, re-encrypt to gain the new protections.

> Note: the **2.x** series offered multiple modes (AES-GCM, ChaCha20-Poly1305, AES-CTR+HMAC) and a footer `END0/NAM0`. **3.0** simplifies to a single cryptographic path (SecretStream) and integrates the footer as authenticated `TAG_FINAL`, preserving the same benefits of integrity, truncation-proofing, and extension restoration.

---

## üîß How it works (v3.0 format overview)

* **Header** (written by libsodium SecretStream) + **KDF header** are **AAD**. Any alteration => authentication failure.
* **Frames**: the plaintext is processed in chunks; each output of `push()` is authenticated.
* **Final tag**: a `TAG_FINAL` closes the stream and carries **authenticated metadata** (`orig_name`, `orig_ext`, `pt_size`, etc.).
* **Size privacy**: optionally, the last block receives **padding** (0 / 4 / 8 / **16 KiB**). The real plaintext size is verified from `pt_size` in `TAG_FINAL`.

---

## üß™ Security model (quick notes)

* **XChaCha20-Poly1305** (AEAD) provides confidentiality + per-frame integrity; `TAG_FINAL` authenticates stream closure.
* **Argon2id** hardens each password guess (Sensitive > Interactive). A strong passphrase remains the primary factor.
* **Header AAD** prevents downgrade/parameter tampering and provides a **commitment** between header and payload.
* **Vault** stores **only already-encrypted outputs**; it adds an optional layer of protection and organization.

## üì¶ Installation

### A) Windows executable (end-users)

1. Download the `.exe` from **Releases**.
2. Run it normally.

   > Tip: do not run as Administrator ‚Äî UAC blocks drag-and-drop from non-elevated windows.

### B) From source (Python 3.11+)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-user>/CryptGuardv2.git
cd CryptGuardv2
python -m venv .venv
# Windows:
.venv\Scripts\activate
# Linux/macOS:
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main_app.py
```

### C) Slim build (PyInstaller, Windows)

```powershell
pyinstaller --onefile --windowed --name "CryptGuard" --icon .\cryptguard.ico main_app.py
```

> Avoid `--collect-all`. Add only the necessary Qt plugins via `--collect-data/--collect-binaries`/`--hidden-import`. Make sure **PyNaCl/libsodium** are present for SecretStream.

---

## üñ•Ô∏è Using the app

1. Select (or drag) a file.
2. Choose **KDF profile** (Interactive/Sensitive) and, if you want, **Pad size** (0‚Äì16 KiB).
3. (Optional) **Expiration date**.
4. Enter a **strong passphrase** and click **Encrypt**.
5. To **Decrypt**, select the `.cg2` and click **Decrypt**.

   * The file is saved with its original name/ext. If a conflict exists, `name(1).ext` is created.
6. **Verify** checks integrity without writing output to disk.
7. **Vault**: tick **Store encrypted file in Vault** when encrypting to move it to the Vault; use the **Vault** button to list/export.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Tuning & options

* **KDF profile**

  * **Interactive**: everyday use; lower latency and RAM.
  * **Sensitive**: higher cost per guess (more time/RAM).
* **Pad size**: **0 / 4 / 8 / 16 KiB**.

  * Larger pad ‚áí better size camouflage, larger `.cg2`.
  * For strong type/size camouflage, combine with **ZIP/Archive** before encrypting.
* **Expiration**: non-secret metadata; apps can use it as a signal (does not prevent decryption).

---

## üîç Troubleshooting

* ‚ÄúInvalidTag / authentication failed‚Äù: corrupted file (header, frame, or final).
* No extension after decrypt: in 3.0 this is restored automatically; if you choose an `out_path` with a different extension, it will be honored.
* Drag-and-drop doesn't work: do not run as Admin (UAC).
* Huge PyInstaller build: avoid `--collect-all`; make a slim build.

---

## üß† Tips

* Prefer **long passphrases** (4‚Äì6 random words) and unique ones.
* **Sensitive** is more resistant to brute-force; use it when you can tolerate higher latency.
* Do not decrypt sensitive content on possibly compromised machines.
* **Backups**: if you lose both the Vault and the passphrase, the content is unrecoverable.
